## 4. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

| Type | Value | Description |
|------|------|------------|
| File Hash | <Hash Value> | Malicious file |
| External IP | <IP Address> | Suspected C2 server |
| Hostname | <Hostname> | Affected endpoint |

---

## 5. Verdict
Based on file analysis, sandbox behavior, and network activity,
the alert was classified as a:

- **Verdict:** <True Positive / False Positive>

The evidence supported this classification with high confidence.

---

## 6. Containment & Response
The following actions were recommended or performed:

- Isolate the affected endpoint
- Block malicious IPs or domains
- Remove or quarantine the malicious file
- Perform a full endpoint scan

---

## 7. Analyst Reflection
This case reinforced understanding of malware investigation workflows,
including alert validation, file reputation analysis, and identifying
malicious network behavior in a SOC environment.
