# 🔘 Cybersecurity-Portfolio

Cybersecurity learning journey and Portfolio

This repository documents my learning journey and hands-on work in cybersecurity, with a focus on understanding security concepts, operational workflows, and defensive thinking rather than tool memorization.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate how I approach security problems, analyze risks, and build a solid foundation for SOC and vulnerability management roles.

## 🔘 About Me
I'm Dana Alamri  , Cybersecurity student and Co-op trainee with a strong interest in defensive security and security operations.  
I focus on building a solid understanding of how security controls, detection logic, and risk-based decisions work in real environments.

My background combines academic study with hands-on labs, vulnerability analysis, and SOC-style investigations, with an emphasis on structured thinking and continuous learning.
