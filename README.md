# 🔘 Cybersecurity-Portfolio

Cybersecurity learning journey and Portfolio

This repository documents my learning journey and hands-on work in cybersecurity, with a focus on understanding security concepts, operational workflows, and defensive thinking rather than tool memorization.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate how I approach security problems, analyze risks, and build a solid foundation for SOC and vulnerability management roles.

## 🔘 About Me

I'm Dana Alamri Cybersecurity student and Co-op trainee with a strong interest in defensive security, risk-based decision making, and secure system design.

I focus on building a solid understanding of how security controls, detection mechanisms, and risk management practices operate in real environments, and how technical findings translate into business and compliance decisions.

My background combines academic study with hands-on labs, vulnerability analysis, and security investigations, with an emphasis on structured thinking, documentation, and aligning security outcomes with organizational risk.
