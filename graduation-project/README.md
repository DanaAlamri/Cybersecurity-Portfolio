## 🧠 Robust and Privacy-Aware EEG Signal Classification for BCI

This project presents a robust and privacy-preserving EEG classification framework for Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs), focusing on motor imagery (MI) decoding under adversarial and privacy threats.

EEG-based BCIs are highly sensitive to noise, subject variability, and adversarial perturbations, while also containing private mental information that must be protected. This project addresses both challenges in a unified pipeline.

## 🔍 Problem Addressed

EEG signals are non-stationary and vary significantly across subjects and sessions

Deep learning models for BCIs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks

Brain signals can leak sensitive mental information if not protected properly

## 💡 Proposed Solution

An end-to-end EEG classification pipeline that integrates:

Euclidean Alignment (EA) to reduce inter-subject/session variability

Alignment-Based Adversarial Training (ABAT) using FGSM and PGD attacks to improve robustness

Differential Privacy (DP-SGD) to protect sensitive EEG data during training

EEGNet as a lightweight and efficient deep learning classifier

The model classifies EEG signals into four motor imagery classes:
Left Hand, Right Hand, Feet, and Tongue.

## 🧪 Dataset
